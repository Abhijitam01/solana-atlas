# UI System

The Solana Playground UI is built around a lightweight design system with:

- Typography: Space Grotesk and IBM Plex Mono
- Atmosphere: layered gradients, subtle grid, and soft blur
- Surfaces: `panel` and `panel-header` utility classes
- Accents: teal, emerald, amber, and sky tones

## Key Tokens
- `--primary` powers interactive emphasis
- `--muted` and `--card` define surface hierarchy
- `--radius` controls rounded geometry across components

## Styleguide
Visit `/styleguide` in the web app to see live component references.
